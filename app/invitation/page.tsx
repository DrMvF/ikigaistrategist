          <strong>Ikigai Strategist for Women</strong> is a radically simple, deeply powerful habit tracker – designed for cyclical clarity. It’s built for you if you’ve ever felt overwhelmed by linear systems, uninspired by generic apps, or just... out of sync.

        <p className="text-lg">
          With our <strong>Triple 4 System</strong>, you align with your inner rhythm:

        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
          <li>🌀 <strong>4 Ikigai Dimensions</strong>: Love, Skill, World, Finance</li>
          <li>🌙 <strong>4 Cycle Phases</strong>: Menstruation, Follicular, Ovulation, Luteal</li>
          <li>🪶 <strong>4 JERT Steps</strong>: Journal, Evaluate, Report, Trajectory</li>
        </ul>

        <p className="text-lg">
          Here’s how it works – your full journey:

        <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-4">
          <li>
            <strong>Start – Tell us where you are</strong><br />
            Enter your current day in your menstrual cycle. We’ll determine your hormonal phase so the rest of your experience flows with – not against – your body.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Journal – Speak your truth</strong><br />
            Whisper or write what’s on your mind. This space is yours – free from judgment, structure, or rules. Just show up as you are.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Evaluate – Add gentle structure</strong><br />
            You rate your entry in 4 dimensions:
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-6 space-y-1">
              <li><strong>Love</strong> – Was there tenderness, connection, intimacy?</li>
              <li><strong>Skill</strong> – Did you feel confident, competent, capable?</li>
              <li><strong>World</strong> – Did you sense connection to a larger purpose or context?</li>
              <li><strong>Finance</strong> – Was there clarity or tension around money or material needs?</li>
            </ul>
            You choose a number from 1–10 for each, like a soft self-inventory.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Report – Meet your pattern</strong><br />
            A radar chart shows you what’s unfolding across a week. You’ll see which energies dominate, and which remain quiet – all layered with your cycle phase.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Trajectory – Watch your evolution</strong><br />
            This gentle line graph traces your Ikigai patterns over time. It’s not about performance. It’s about rhythm.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Triple 4 Empowerment Report – Your personal pulse</strong><br />
            Every few days, you’ll receive a gentle integration: your current cycle day, JERT status, and Ikigai pulse – reflected back as a kind reminder of where you are.
          </li>
        </ol>

          The world is becoming more masculine again – in politics, in systems, in pace. But you are not here to adapt. You are here to re-lead – from within.
