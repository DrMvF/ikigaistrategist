        </p>

        <p className="text-lg">
          With our <strong>Triple 4 System</strong>, you align with your inner rhythm:

        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
          <li>ðŸŒ€ <strong>4 Ikigai Dimensions</strong>: Love, Skill, World, Finance</li>
          <li>ðŸŒ™ <strong>4 Cycle Phases</strong>: Menstruation, Follicular, Ovulation, Luteal</li>
          <li>ðŸª¶ <strong>4 JERT Steps</strong>: Journal, Evaluate, Report, Trajectory</li>
        </ul>

        <p className="text-lg">
          Hereâ€™s how it works â€“ your full journey:

        <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-4">
          <li>
            <strong>Start â€“ Tell us where you are</strong><br />
            Enter your current day in your menstrual cycle. Weâ€™ll determine your hormonal phase so the rest of your experience flows with â€“ not against â€“ your body.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Journal â€“ Speak your truth</strong><br />
            Whisper or write whatâ€™s on your mind. This space is yours â€“ free from judgment, structure, or rules. Just show up as you are.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Evaluate â€“ Add gentle structure</strong><br />
            You rate your entry in 4 dimensions:
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-6 space-y-1">
              <li><strong>Love</strong> â€“ Was there tenderness, connection, intimacy?</li>
              <li><strong>Skill</strong> â€“ Did you feel confident, competent, capable?</li>
              <li><strong>World</strong> â€“ Did you sense connection to a larger purpose or context?</li>
              <li><strong>Finance</strong> â€“ Was there clarity or tension around money or material needs?</li>
            </ul>
            You choose a number from 1â€“10 for each, like a soft self-inventory.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Report â€“ Meet your pattern</strong><br />
            A radar chart shows you whatâ€™s unfolding across a week. Youâ€™ll see which energies dominate, and which remain quiet â€“ all layered with your cycle phase.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Trajectory â€“ Watch your evolution</strong><br />
            This gentle line graph traces your Ikigai patterns over time. Itâ€™s not about performance. Itâ€™s about rhythm.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Triple 4 Empowerment Report â€“ Your personal pulse</strong><br />
            Every few days, youâ€™ll receive a gentle integration: your current cycle day, JERT status, and Ikigai pulse â€“ reflected back as a kind reminder of where you are.
          </li>
        </ol>

          The world is becoming more masculine again â€“ in politics, in systems, in pace. But you are not here to adapt. You are here to re-lead â€“ from within.
